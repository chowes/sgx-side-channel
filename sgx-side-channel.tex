\begin{abstract}

Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a set of hardware instructions extending the Intel architecture that allows user-level software to run securely when all other software on the system is untrusted. SGX uses secure enclaves running in processor reserved memory combined with software attestation to provide confidentiality, integrity, and freshness guarantees to users wishing to execute software on an untrusted remote system. However, SGX is vulnerable to a number of software side-channel attacks, which leverage performance measurements to determine memory access patterns in order to derive secrets from software executing in secure SGX enclaves. SGX vulnerabilities to software side-channel attacks and directions for future research are discussed.
