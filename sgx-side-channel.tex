\begin{abstract}

Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a hardware-backed security extension of the Intel architecture that allows user-level software to run securely in an environment where all other software on the host system is untrusted. SGX uses secure enclaves running in Processor Reserved Memory combined with a software attestation scheme to provide confidentiality and integrity guarantees to users wishing to execute software on an untrusted remote system. SGX is vulnerable to a number of software side-channel attacks, which leverage performance measurements to determine memory access patterns and derive secrets from software executing in secure SGX enclaves. SGX vulnerabilities to software side-channel attacks, possible countermeasures, and directions for future research are discussed.
