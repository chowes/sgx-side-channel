	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive survey of routing protocols proposed for routing in Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks (VDTN) in vehicular environment. DTNs are utilized in various operational environments, including those subject to disruption and disconnection and those with high-delay, such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET). We focus on a special type of VANET, where the vehicular traffic is sparse and direct end-to-end paths between communicating parties do not always exist. Thus, communication in this context falls into the category of Vehicular Delay Tolerant Network (VDTN). Due to the limited transmission range of an RSU (Road Side Unit), remote vehicles, in VDTN, may not connect to the RSU directly and thus have to rely on intermediate vehicles to relay the packets. During the message relay process, complete end-to-end paths may not exist in highly partitioned VANETs. Therefore, the intermediate vehicles must buffer and forward messages opportunistically. Through buffer, carry and forward, the message can eventually be delivered to the destination even if an end-to-end connection never exists between source and destination. The main objective of routing protocols in DTN is to maximize the probability of delivery to the destination while minimizing the end-to-end delay. Also, vehicular traffic models are important for DTN routing in vehicle networks because the performance of DTN routing protocols is closely related to population and mobility models of the network.},

One approach to enable runnable network systems papers is Container-Based Emulation (CBE), where an environment of virtual hosts, switches, and links runs on a modern multicore server, using real application and kernel code with software-emulated network elements. CBE combines many of the best features of software simulators and hardware testbeds, but its performance fidelity is unproven. In this paper, we put CBE to the test, using our prototype, Mininet-HiFi, to reproduce key results from published network experiments such as DCTCP, Hedera, and router buffer sizing. We report lessons learned from a graduate networking class at Stanford, where 37 students used our platform to replicate 18 published results of their own choosing. Our experiences suggest that CBE makes research results easier to reproduce and build upon.},

For many important data-center applications such as MapReduce and Search, this many-to-one traffic pattern is common. Hence TCP incast congestion may severely degrade their performances, e.g., by increasing response time. In this paper, we study TCP incast in detail by focusing on the relationships between TCP throughput, round-trip time (RTT), and receive window. Unlike previous approaches, which mitigate the impact of TCP incast congestion by using a fine-grained timeout value, our idea is to design an Incast congestion Control for TCP (ICTCP) scheme on the receiver side. In particular, our method adjusts the TCP receive window proactively before packet loss occurs. The implementation and experiments in our testbed demonstrate that we achieve almost zero timeouts and high goodput for TCP incast.},

	abstract = {In modern computer systems, user processes are isolated from each other by the operating system and the hardware. Additionally, in a cloud scenario it is crucial that the hypervisor isolates tenants from other tenants that are co-located on the same physical machine. However, the hypervisor does not protect tenants against the cloud provider and thus the supplied operating system and hardware. Intel SGX provides a mechanism that addresses this scenario. It aims at protecting user-level software from attacks from other processes, the operating system, and even physical attackers. In this paper, we demonstrate fine-grained software-based side-channel attacks from a malicious SGX enclave targeting co-located enclaves. Our attack is the first malware running on real SGX hardware, abusing SGX protection features to conceal itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack both in a native environment and across multiple Docker containers. We perform a Prime+Probe cache side-channel attack on a co-located SGX enclave running an up-to-date RSA implementation that uses a constant-time multiplication primitive. The attack works although in SGX enclaves there are no timers, no large pages, no physical addresses, and no shared memory. In a semi-synchronous attack, we extract 96\% of an RSA private key from a single trace. We extract the full RSA private key in an automated attack from 11 traces within 5 minutes.},

The problem has the added constraints of finite buffers at each node and the general property that no contemporaneous end-to-end path may ever exist. This situation limits the applicability of traditional routing approaches that tend to treat outages as failures and seek to find an existing end-to-end path. We propose a framework for evaluating routing algorithms in such environments. We then develop several algorithms and use simulations to compare their performance with respect to the amount of knowledge they require about network topology. We find that, as expected, the algorithms using the least knowledge tend to perform poorly. We also find that with limited additional knowledge, far less than complete global knowledge, efficient algorithms can be constructed for routing in such environments. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such investigation of routing issues in DTNs.},

	abstract = {Delay-tolerant Wi-Fi offloading is known to improve overall mobile network bandwidth at low delay and low cost. Yet, in reality, we rarely find mobile apps that fully support opportunistic Wi-Fi access. This is mainly because it is still challenging to develop delay-tolerant mobile apps due to the complexity of handling network disruptions and delays. In this paper, we present Cedos, a practical delay-tolerant mobile network access architecture in which one can easily build a mobile app. Cedos consists of three components. First, it provides a familiar socket API whose semantics conforms to TCP, while the underlying protocol, D2TP, transparently handles network disruptions and delays in mobility. Second, Cedos allows the developers to explicitly exploit delays in mobile apps. App developers can express maximum user-specified delays in content download or use the API for real-time buffer management at opportunistic Wi-Fi usage. Third, for backward compatibility to existing TCP-based servers, Cedos provides D2Prox, a protocol-translation Web proxy. D2Prox allows intermittent connections on the mobile device side, but correctly translates Web transactions with traditional TCP servers. We demonstrate the practicality of Cedos by porting mobile Firefox and VLC video streaming client to using the API. We also implement delay/disruption-tolerant podcast client and run a field study with 50 people for eight weeks. We find that up to 92.4\% of the podcast traffic is offloaded to Wi-Fi, and one can watch a streaming video in a moving train while offloading 48\% of the content to Wi-Fi without a single pause.},

	abstract = {The Internet has led to the creation of a digital society, where (almost) everything is connected and is accessible from anywhere. However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes. To make matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns, introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound application programming interfaces (APIs), network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this - ew paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms - with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security, and dependability - as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.},

	abstract = {Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) protects the confidentiality and integrity of an unprivileged program running inside a secure enclave from a privileged attacker who has full control of the entire operating system (OS). Program execution inside this enclave is therefore referred to as shielded. Unfortunately, shielded execution does not protect programs from side-channel attacks by a privileged attacker. For instance, it has been shown that by changing page table entries of memory pages used by shielded execution, a malicious OS kernel could observe memory page accesses from the execution and hence infer a wide range of sensitive information about it. In fact, this page-fault side channel is only an instance of a category of side-channel attacks, here called privileged side-channel attacks, in which privileged attackers frequently preempt the shielded execution to obtain fine-grained side-channel observations. In this paper, we present Deja Vu, a software framework that enables a shielded execution to detect such privileged side-channel attacks. Specifically, we build into shielded execution the ability to check program execution time at the granularity of paths in its control-flow graph. To provide a trustworthy source of time measurement, Deja Vu implements a novel software reference clock that is protected by Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX), a hardware implementation of transactional memory. Evaluations show that Deja Vu effectively detects side-channel attacks against shielded execution and against the reference clock itself.},

Legacy applications continue to run on the untrusted operating system, while a small hyper visor or trusted hardware prevents the operating system from accessing the applications' memory. In this paper, we introduce controlled-channel attacks, a new type of side-channel attack that allows an untrusted operating system to extract large amounts of sensitive information from protected applications on systems like Overshadow, Ink Tag or Haven. We implement the attacks on Haven and Ink Tag and demonstrate their power by extracting complete text documents and outlines of JPEG images from widely deployed application libraries. Given these attacks, it is unclear if Over shadow's vision of protecting unmodified legacy applications from legacy operating systems running on off-the-shelf hardware is still tenable.},

	abstract = {New hardware primitives such as Intel SGX secure a user-level process in presence of an untrusted or compromised OS. Such "enclaved execution" systems are vulnerable to several side-channels, one of which is the page fault channel. In this paper, we show that the page fault side-channel has sufficient channel capacity to extract bits of encryption keys from commodity implementations of cryptographic routines in OpenSSL and Libgcrypt --- leaking 27\% on average and up to 100\% of the secret bits in many case-studies. To mitigate this, we propose a software-only defense that masks page fault patterns by determinising the program's memory access behavior. We show that such a technique can be built into a compiler, and implement it for a subset of C which is sufficient to handle the cryptographic routines we study. This defense when implemented generically can have significant overhead of up to 4000X, but with help of developer-assisted compiler optimizations, the overhead reduces to at most 29.22\% in our case studies. Finally, we discuss scope for hardware-assisted defenses, and show one solution that can reduce overheads to 6.77\% with support from hardware changes.},

However in such dynamic networks, which could be considered as a set of intermittently connected nodes, message forwarding strategy is a key issue. Existing routing solutions concentrate mainly on two major routing families flooding and knowledge based algorithms. This paper presents SocialRouting - the social-based routing algorithm designed for DTN. The use of the social properties of wireless mobile nodes is the novel way of message routing that is based on message ferrying between separated parts of the network. Proposed idea has been extensively tested using simulation tools. The simulations were made based on especially designed for measurements in DTN scenarios and compared with popular solutions.},

However, the mobility of nodes, such as buses, may not be completely predictable due to factors such as traffic load, road condition, the number of passengers getting on and off the buses, and the operations of traffic lights. In this paper, we adapt the space-time graph by augmenting each horizontal edge with a direct contact probability to model the uncertainty of connectivity. With such an augmented space-time graph, our goal is to compute a shortest routing path satisfying a given end-to-end delivery reliability in a DTN. To facilitate such computation, we adapt the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the maximum contact probability matrix at each time interval. By using an iterative matrix multiplication scheme on a maximum contact matrix, we can compute the shortest path satisfying the reliability constraint. Simulation results validate the performance of our solution which achieves a good balance between delay and reliability.},
